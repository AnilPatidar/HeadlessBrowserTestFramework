/**
 * Unit test for simple App.
 * 
 * HtmlUnitDriver is headless browser,
 * 
 * Features:
 * 
 *  Light Weight Fastest Implementation of WebDriver Platform
 * 
 * Independent There is support for proxy server available Support for the HTTPS
 * and HTTP protocols Support for HTML responses ( clicking links, submitting
 * forms, walking the DOM model of the HTML document etc.)
 * 
 * Support for cookies ,Proxy server support Support for basic and NTLM authentication Excellen
 * t
 * JavaScript support Support for submit methods GET and POST Ability to
 * customize the request headers being sent to the server Ability to determine
 * whether failing responses from the server should throw exceptions or should
 * be returned as pages of the appropriate type
 * 
 * Minimal visual interruption because of lack of graphical display Swifter
 * execution as compared to real browsers because the simulated browser is a
 * mere native code library hence faster to launch and doesnâ€™t require much time
 * in communication as well as drawing and operating things on your screen.
 * 
 * Platform independent and supports concurrent test runs. Hence, most suitable
 * for Load testing. Is a pure Java based solution using the JS engine The
 * simulated browser is filled with key features depicting a rich client-side
 * behaviour with quicker execution, as compared to other driver instances Is
 * able to deal with HTTPS security, as well Possesses more dependability than a
 * real browser. Simulated browsers are highly independent and hence its
 * operation is quite smooth and dependable Provision to choose other browser
 * versions to testing using HtmlUnitDriver It is platform independent and
 * easier to run several tests concurrently. Ideal for Load Testing.
 * 
 * Challenges faced while using HtmlUnitDriver for headless browser testing
 * 
 * henever a test fails or is interrupted, it becomes tough to debug since it is
 * difficult to see it physically on the browser of your machine. Even if there
 * are chances of debugging, the time frame to do the same is quite high
 * Simulation of other browsers is possible, e.g. Firefox, IE etc. but there is
 * no surety to which extent these real world browsers would be replicated
 * JavaScript is disabled, by default and would have to be enabled when the
 * script is being written For other browsers, emulation of JS behavior is
 * difficult
